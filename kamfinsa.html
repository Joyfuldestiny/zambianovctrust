          <h2><span>Kanfinsa Mision's Project</span></h2>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>The picture you see here- shows Rev. . Lameck G C Nyendwa in a Red T. Shirt and cap director of Zambian OVC Trust, pastor Morgan Chilulu with orphaned and vulnerable children who attend school at the Kamfinsa Mission center.

These children you see are just about to receive clothes and food from Rev.   Lameck GC. Nyendwa donated by well wishers. Most of these children’s parents have died from HIV/AIDS and are being taken care of or kept by relatives in this case grand parents who can not afford any food or send these kids to school. 6 years ago the prayer of these kids was answered, when Rev GLC Nyendwa the director of Zambian OVC Trust and founder of  Calvarian ministries- introduced a comprehensive home based care program in which we feed these kids, send them to school and provide good medication for them.</p>

<p>Rev LCG Nyendwa through Zambian Orphans and Vulnerable Children Trust and (CALVARIAN MINISTRIES)- went ahead to open a school for them right in our Church building at Kamfinsa to provide both secular and spiritual education for these children. In addition ZAMBIAN OVC TRUST  ,,provides food ,Education, material and Simple medication and clothes to these orphaned and Vulnerable Children. </p>
<p>Beloved, taking care of the orphaned and neglected children is some thing near the heart of God and God loves these precious children, they will grow up to become responsible men and women in the society because you are helping. Most of the stories of these children are quiet exciting, as we hear a lot of them tell us what they want to become in the future.</p>

<p>Amongst these children, there are others who want to become Doctors, Nurses and Teachers, still others have ambitions of becoming lawyers and politicians who want to come and rule this country in the future,so the ZAMBIAN OVC TRUST and its partners local and overseas   are on the front line leading the way in order to help these Kamfinsa children‘s dream come to pass and true.</p>

<p>Kamfinsa Mission Church under our organization is situated along Kitwe and Ndola Dual carriage way approximately 7 kilometers from Kitwe town center.

The names and personal stories of each child along these  children will be sent in the mail or via email to our valued partners who request for them.
