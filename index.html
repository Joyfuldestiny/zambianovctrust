            <p>The AIDS pandemic is just not affecting adults perhaps even more cruelly, it is affecting children and Africa has been hardest hit 90% of the world's orphans live in sub-sahara Africa - were Zambia falls.</a> Millions of children in sub-sahan Africa have lost one or both parents due to AIDS. UN-AIDS estimates that the number of orphaned children in sub-sahara region will raise toan stimated 25,000, 000 to 40, 000, 000 (40 million by the year 2020. Significantly at higher risk of HIV infection, emotionally vulnerable and financially desparate are orphaned children - who are more likely to be exually abused and forced into exploitive situations -such as prostitution as a means of survival in case of the girl children, as for boy children- they become destitute, sleeping and begging for food in the street.</p>
            <p><strong>A lot of children in sub- sahara suffer from stigmatization, sexual exploitation and enadequate education. AIDS prevention instruction and financial support are sorely needed.</strong> To achieve this and in order to help alleviate the many problems orphans are facing, Zambia Orphans and Vulnerable Children with its projects plans to invest or purchase a big farm were we will grow food and other farm produce to help feed the children and educate them</p>

                      <p>We hope that through the help of various cooperating partners and our valued donors, the various indicated mentioned programmes and activities in our organization will continue be sustained in order to alleviate the sufferings of the orphaned children and reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in our country Zambia and Africa.<br>
            The Zambia Ophans & Vulnerable Children Trust and its projects was established in 1991, in Kitwe Zambia, as  we indicated in our organization’s goal and objectives, our overall goal has always been to demonstrate the love of God sharing what we have with the suffering children and to alleviate the plight of the vulnerable and orphaned children, whose parents have died of HIV/AIDS. Our organization was legally allowed to operate due to its good programmes to the needy children and the poor 1991 even if a ban to register new Christian Organization in the country was in place until 1995 when we were given the registration certificate. <br>
The organization and its projects started small, but over the years has grown appreciably exchanging information and net-working with other NGOs in the fight against HIV/AIDs and looking after a lot of orphans and vulnerable children in Zambia. Zambia Ophans & Vulnerable Children Trust is a recognized organization by the government of Zambia, hence government has awarded our organization a tax free or funding facility on anything or goods being imported into the country by the organization.
