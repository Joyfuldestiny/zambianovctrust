          <p>In 1991, the crisis led to the formation of Calvarian Ministries a Christian NGO which sponsors projects in, Zambia Ophans & Vulnerable Children Trust, Life Line project for People living with HIV/AIDS, Luangwa , Kamfinsa and Masaiti / OVC’s children project. Dedicated to being obedient to the biblical call to look after the orphans, widows and families - who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS in their distress putting hope back and creating a better tomorrow for children in Zambia - Africa.  
Zambia Ophans & Vulnerable Children Trust through its projects rescues and raises orphans in Zambia helping them achieve healthy, prosperous and fulfilling lives. It nurtures and educates these children, while providing healthy care, food and Aids prevention instruction workshops.
